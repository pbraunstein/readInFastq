#readInFastq
##### Philip Braunstein (pbraunstein12@gamail.com)

This program is an example of clean Python code to read in a FASTQ file as well as a sample FASTQ file from the 1000 genomes project.

This is particularly useful to new computational biology students because reading in FASTQ files is a very important and frequent task.
